# Detailed-student-score-analysis
Here, I did an in-depth analysis on a sample data of student scores and their dependecies as to why some have good scores in different subjects and some don't.
This is a detailed notebook with multiple graphs and different sections. Some of the dependencies include practicing sports, is first child and parent's education.
I found some anomalies in this data and some commonalities which are all concluded after each step(if any found) and lastly in the end of the notebook.
